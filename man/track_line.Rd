\usage{
track_line(
  seed,
  conductivity,
  existing_network = NULL,
  fov = 85,
  sightline = 50,
  min_conductivity = 0.4,
  ...,
  disp = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{line (\code{sf} format)}

\item{conductivity}{raster (\code{raster} format)}

\item{fov}{numeric. Field of view (degrees) ahead of the search vector.}

\item{sightline}{numeric (distance unit). Search distance used to find the next most probable
point on the road.}
}
\value{
list, \code{line} being the road found (as \code{sfc}) and \code{cost} a numeric vector
of cost at each invidual vertices of the line.
}
\description{
Drive along an unknown road in a conductivity raster starting only with a small piece
of road segment pointing in the right direction.
